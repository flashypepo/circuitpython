Adafruit CircuitPython Library for the HT16K33-based LED Matrices
******************************************************

This is a library for using the IÂ²C-based LED matrices with the HT16K33 chip.
It supports both 16x8 and 8x8 matrices, as well as 7- and 14-segment displays.

Note this library is intended for Adafruit CircuitPython's API.  For a library
compatible with MicroPython machine API see this library: https://github.com/adafruit/micropython-adafruit-ht16k33
